#summary This will describe the SmartLobby extension distributed with SmartSocket.

= Introduction =

SmartLobby can be located in the Extensions directory.

Source:
http://code.google.com/p/smartsocket/source/browse/#svn/stable/Extensions/SmartLobby

It acts as a chat lobby / game launcher. It uses XML to pass data back and fourth between the client and server, and to other users in the same room.

At the time of writing this, SmartLobby is just functional enough to chat in the main lobby and view user entrances and exits. Feel free to grab the stable branch from SVN and add to this baby. Post a merge and I'll put it in if it's good!
